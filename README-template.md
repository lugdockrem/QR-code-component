## My process

I'm a newbie. I'm from Ukraine and I recently started studying the FullStack Developer course on the Ukrainian online educational platform GoIT LMS. In the first stage, I studied Precourse 2.0, Soft Skills 1.1, and HTML+CSS 2.1, including the Mobile-first workflow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I studied Precourse 2.0, Soft Skills 1.1, and HTML+CSS 2.1, including the Mobile-first workflow. But to be honest, my head is a bit of a mess right now because I've learned a lot of material in a short period of time. I need to keep improving myself.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to learn JavaScript 3.0, Node.js, React, and more.
